## Search Screenshot / Reverse Image Search 

This script allows users to take a screenshot using the windows DLL call to the built in Screen Snip tool for Windows. 
The screenshot is then added to the clipboard and the script runs a Google Lens search of the screenshot. 

Functionally this enables users to do a reverse image search of whatever they can see on their screen.
