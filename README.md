# AHK
Repo for my AHK scripts so I can track between work / personal computer. 

AutoHotKey is publicly available free software for Windows machines. 

Find the link to download it here: https://www.autohotkey.com/download/

The zip can be downloaded, extracted, and the installation step can be run from the file explorer. 

This will install AHKv2 on your machine.

AutoHotKey scripts can be run by double clicking on the script in the file explorer 
Each script needs to have the extension ".ahk".

You can tell if a script is running (usually) by checking the tray on your windows toolbar

If you'd prefer to have your scripts launch at startup rather than double clicking each time, you can add them to the startup directory on your computer. 

Startup folder is found by searching "Run" on the task bar and inputting the following cmd : shell:startup
