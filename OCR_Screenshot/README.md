## OCR Screensnip

OCR Screensnip is a script that allows the user to take a screenshot of their desktop across and area they define using the built in screenshotting tool for windows. 

There is an OCR library (Created by Descolada) which then captures any text visible in the screenshot. 

The script then copies all of the information to the clipboard. 

The user can then paste this information as needed.
