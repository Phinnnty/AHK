## WebView2

The Microsoft Edge WebView2 control enables you to host web content in your application using Microsoft Edge (Chromium) as the rendering engine. For more information, see Overview of [Microsoft Edge WebView2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/reference/win32/?view=webview2-1.0.674-prerelease) and Getting Started with WebView2.

The WebView2 Runtime is built into Win10(latest version) and Win11 and can be easily used in AHK.

This is the basis of the AI WebView Chats scritps which allow users to access ChatGPT and Claude 3.5 from what appears to be their desktop. 

Users can highlight texy anywhere on their screen and send it to Chat GPT or Claude 3.5 alongside a prompt for the AI to carry out tasks on the copied content.
